You are given a list nums of length n + 1 picked from the range 1, 2, ..., n. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. Find and return it. There is guaranteed to be exactly one duplicate.

Bonus: Can you do this in O(n)\mathcal{O}(n)O(n) time and O(1)\mathcal{O}(1)O(1) space?

Constraints

    n ≤ 10,000

Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]

Output

1

Example 2
Input

nums = [4, 2, 1, 3, 2]

Output

2
