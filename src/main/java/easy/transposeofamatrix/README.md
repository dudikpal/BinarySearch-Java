### Transpose of a Matrix

Given an integer square (n by n) matrix, return its transpose. A transpose of a matrix switches the row and column indices. That is, for every r and c, matrix[r][c] = matrix[c][r].

Constraints

    n ≤ 100

Example 1
Input

matrix = [
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9]
]

Output

[
[1, 4, 7],
[2, 5, 8],
[3, 6, 9]
]
